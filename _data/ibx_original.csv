A collaboratively written history of Britain, the Chronicles was used to inform English literary works of the Renaissance, including those of Marlowe, Spenser, and most famously Shakespeare. The marginalia (marks made by the reader in the margins and other blank spaces of the text) throughout this copy includes whimsical drawings of men in contemporary Renaissance dress (ruffs and hats with large plumes) and writing in secretary hand reflecting on the text. PARAGRAPH The owner made use of pages left entirely blank by filling it with doodles and the products of his attempt to practice his penmanship and lines in letters, including his sign-off. Presumably the owner’s name was “John Hatfeeld,” for two copies of the lines “At your honor’s commandement your obedient servant John Hatfeeld” appear. In these instances the owner is not producing the form of marginalia that scholar William Sherman describes in Used Books as “a glossarial note or commentary against a word or passage.” Instead he is filling up pages as he might fill up the spaces of his mind with thoughts and images as they occur to him. The owner made his mark on the book as much by commenting on the text and copying its characters as by filling its blank spaces into a repository for the free flowing materials of his mind."
ibx2_beze,"Icones, id est verae imagines virorum doctrina simul et pietate illustrium [...] quibus adiectae sunt nonnullae picturae quas Emblemata vocant.","Bèze, Théodore de",Geneuae,1580,https://library.nyu.edu/persistent/lcn/nyu_aleph000922502?institution=NYU&persistent,Fill,"Théodore de Bèze (1519-1605 ) was a prominent French Calvinist theologian. His Icones consists of two parts: the first is a gallery of notable religious figures who contributed to the Reformation, including Luther, Calvin and Erasmus. Presented in woodcut portraits and brief biographies, the gallery invites interaction by leaving frames blank for figures whose portraits are not available at the time, but will emerge after the book’s publication. Interestingly the backs of the engravings pasted in by the reader reveal that they were cut out of other books published close to the same time period. Additional scraps of paper are attached to the engravings or blank mirrors and bear sketches made by a book owner copying the portraits. PARAGRAPH The second portion of the book presents the 44 emblems that make Icones a notable example of the early modern emblem book genre. Emblem books set words and images into interplay with each other by presenting a mysterious visual icon or image with an accompanying epigram or motto. While the first section of the book, with its visual parade of illustrious religious leaders, appears unrelated to the emblems, the first few, which present images of frames with landscapes that surround empty spaces in which a circle floats, suggest what the connection might be. PARAGRAPH The epigram beneath the first emblem presents its circle as an image both of eternal life and God’s perfection, suggesting that by focusing on the image in front of them, and following the subsequent emblems to the end, the reader might enact the circular path of eternity. Through applying the idea of God’s eternity to one’s own life, one might situate themselves inside the empty space of the circle that is in turn surrounded by a frame. In this way the emblem book portion of Icones offers interactive possibilities as its portraits do, which similarly invite the reader’s “input” by leaving some of its spaces intentionally blank."

The 6th edition, published in 1607, was the first folio sized edition, as well as the first to include maps for this foundational antiquarian work. Camden (1551-1623) was pivotal in developing antiquarianism, a novel method of studying Britain’s ancient past that placed an emphasis on the direct study of its artifacts—coins, ruins, heraldry, inscriptions—as found in its different regions. Every graphic feature in this copy of the book was filled by hand with color, from printer’s ornaments and drop cap initials to maps and illustrations of antique coins and inscriptions. While it is difficult to determine whether the coloring was done professionally in the print shop or by an extremely skilled and diligent reader, the addition of color brings different interactive elements to the book. Filling in the book with a new element after its printing is one, and bringing the past to life with the enlivening properties of color is another."
ibx4_stow,"A Survey of the cities of London and Westminster, 6th edition","Stow, John and John Strype",London,1754,https://library.nyu.edu/persistent/lcn/nyu_aleph003081356?institution=NYU&persistent,Fill,"This copy of John Stow’s Survey of London, as many extra-illustrated books do, includes several foldout prints. Stow (1525-1605), like William Camden (author of Britannia HYPERLINK ""BRITANNIA""), was a 16th-century antiquarian whose Survey accomplished a similar goal of providing a historical account of a topographical region or area. In Stow’s case, the target area was London. Essentially a travel guide, his Survey was compiled from archival material related to London’s architectural monuments and social activities. It was updated several times. The exhibition features the eighteenth-century edition of John Strype (1643-1737), which came endowed with contemporary maps and plates and was produced in lavish folio format. PARAGRAPH By extra-illustrating this copy of the book, or making it more visually bountiful by adding new plates, the owner was participating in a pastime that was popular for readers from the 1770s to the early 20th century. In doing so, the owner added new meaning to the book. Not a passive reader of Stow’s and Strype’s guided tours of London’s streets, the owner created their own journey through London with the materials of their personal print collection, creating more stopping points with new prints to unfold along the way."
ibx5_radcliffe,A Sicilian Romance,"Radcliffe, Ann",London,1790,https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph000758721,Fill,"This copy of Ann Radcliffe’s novel A Sicilian Romance (1790) is unusual for being extra-illustrated, as the copy of Stow’s Survey HYPERLINK “SURVEY” in this exhibition is. Most commonly, extra-illustrated (supplemented with print illustrations from other sources) books are in large formats, and are devoted not to fiction, but to historical biography, antiquarian history and travel, or works by Shakespeare. Traditionally appearing in pocket sized, duodecimo format, eighteenth-century novels in contrast lacked the space for “holding” additional engraved prints, whose original sizes far exceed the dimensions of a standard novel. Yet the owner of this copy of Radcliffe’s novel inventively used miniature engravings--possibly cut out from another source--to fill in the bits of blank spaces at the end and beginning of chapters. PARAGRAPH The small pictures pasted into the novel by its owner depict picturesque landscape scenes that stir the imagination and correspond with scenes described in the narrative, such as ruined castles by the sea covered in overgrown ivy, and views of Italian volcanoes. Human figures from the Gothic era, from knights in armor riding horseback to a nun in a white habit frightened by an invisible visitor to her prayer chamber, might be identified as characters in the novel. Unlike inserted foldouts typically used for extra-illustration, these small prints fit well within the boundaries of the book’s original pages as well as the novel’s storyline. They draw the reader further into the Gothic world imagined by Radcliffe and offer a chance to see it realized in images, while at the same time turning the owner’s copy of the book into an individualized one."
ibx6_wollstonecraft,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,"Wollstonecraft, Mary",Boston,1792,https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph001366096,Fill,"This American edition of Mary Wollstonecraft’s early feminist manifesto was owned and read by a responsive reader whose interactions with the text surface in thoughtful underlinings and summaries of affecting passages and one word responses such as “fools” and “alas.” These markings indicate the reader’s sensitivity to injustice and outrage over the hypocrisies and double standards in eighteenth-century social attitudes towards women exposed by Wollstonecraft. The most emphatic and “hands-on” signs of the reader’s engagement with Wollsteoncraft’s arguments are the manicules used to wreathe lines that were found particularly significant. The book provides tangible evidence of the powerful responses Wollstonecraft’s revolutionary treatise stirred in contemporary readers. In its margins, the reader found a space for expressing their own views through digesting and reflecting on Wollstonecraft’s."
ibx7_robins_postcard,Elizabeth Robins Papers,"Robins, Elizabeth",Alaska,1900,https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/ci13eu/nyu_aleph006049994,Fill,"This card sent by American-born writer, actress and suffragist Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952), a resident of England, from Alaska in 1900 to Florence Bell in Yorkshire, England exemplifies an early form of postcard known as a notecard. Rather than a picture, the front side of the card is reserved for the address of the recipient, and the verso offers space for a message. Meant to be filled in by the sender and read by a distant party, the proto-postcard format provides a fixed structure for concisely formulated personal expressions of the sender’s own choosing. In Alaska looking for her missing brother in the gold rush camps, Robins used the modern medium of the postcard to convey to her friend the most immediate and everyday details from an extraordinary episode in her remarkable life."

His book is a commonplace book in the most traditional, Renaissance humanist sense: a collection of excerpts from the works of classical authors organized under headings. These include abstract topics from “arrogance,” “beauty,” “war,” “good men exemplified,” and “God” to “innocence,” “fear” and “hope.” An index helps the reader locate the corresponding pages for topics. The small size of the sextodecimo format book (16mo or 4 x 6.8 inches) facilitates the book’s intended use as a portable aid to help its owner memorize passages related to given topics and have them ready to recite when the occasion calls for them. Throughout the early modern period, commonplace books were often created by hand out of blank notebooks, and filled and organized according to the owners’ reading practices. Such commonplace books were our first personal information management systems before the age of social media, smart phones and laptop computers."

The book’s physical elements, apart from its massive size, befit its historical significance. Elaborate paratextual (aspects of the book adjacent to the main text) features include monthly calendars for marking holy days with rubricated (red) letters, and genealogical tree charts of Biblical figures and their families. PARAGRAPH More than a century after its publication, the book’s succession of owners, four generations of the Davies family in Gloucestershire, England, began using its parts as a repository for pivotal events in family members’ lives. On the front pastedown and end paper are the dates of family members’ births, baptisms, weddings and deaths written in different hands. 1742 is the earliest date recorded, the year when Reverend William Davies was born. Additional lines are devoted to significant events in his life, as well as those in his sons’ and their childrens’, with different sections reserved for different family lines. PARAGRAPH Storylines ensue with implied or explicit emotional richness in the very act of writing down the dates, names and descriptions of pivotal events. On August 20, 1816, for instance, the younger William Davies wrote, “This morning at half past 2 o’Clock my ever dear beloved wife...departed this life to my great and inexpressible grief (aged twenty eight years).” With these entries the Davies family in effect had interwoven their lives and times into the Bible’s fabric, an indicator of how influential and pervasive the King James Bible was as a dominant text in the lives of the English, gathered together by their faith as well as family connections."
ibx10_smith_martha,[Martha Smith Her Book],"Smith, Martha",England,ca. 1655-1697,https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/ci13eu/nyu_aleph003620145,Gather,"Martha Smith’s book exemplifies one of the most prevalent forms of manuscript collection in the early modern period (ca. 1550-1800): the recipe book. Predecessors to this type of manuscript book include medieval medical recipe books known as “receptaria” used in monasteries as well as miscellanies and commonplace books, of which the recipe book is a type. Recorded in a neat and meticulous hand, the recipes are for both medicine and food. Smith organized her notebook in a deliberate fashion, devoting the first half to medicinal recipes and the second half to food recipes. “A drinke for the cough of the lungs” begins the medicinal recipe section and “To make sugar cakes” begins the food recipe section. A blank page and a half separates the two halves, suggesting she filled each half simultaneously as she encountered each type of recipe. PARAGRAPH The words “Martha Smith her booke,” with Smith’s name in extra large letters, appear on the first page of the notebook. This indubitable mark of ownership is a common sight in notebooks of the period. Books of this nature serve as repositories for the self and are a form of life writing. They are sites in which information useful for domestic life encountered and chosen by the notebook creator are kept, ready to be consulted when needed by her. Scraps of paper with additional medicinal recipes scribbled on them and tucked at the back of the notebook written in a different hand. A second name, Emily E. Bleecky, inscribed beneath Smith’s on the title page, shows a member of a later generation used Smith’s collection of recipes and incorporated them into her life as well."

Composed by several hands but compiled by one person, this kind of notebook served as a repository for the taste, talent and viewpoints of a collective body of individual men and women. Consisting of drawings, poems, riddles and games, the entries of friendship albums were considered gifts by their inscriber. They also carried with them signs of their social status and education, as each entry was an opportunity to demonstrate one’s knowledge and accomplishments--such as knowledge of French--as well as elegance of handwriting. PARAGRAPH An object of private circulation, the book would be looked at, signed and filled in by family members (Blechynden’s sisters Emma and Sarah) and visitors to the compiler’s home, or would travel with her. Here, the term “commonplace” takes on new meaning as the book itself, a blank space that was progressively filled up by the people its owner interacted with and wanted to memorialize with the written and drawn products of their own hands. Each entertaining page constitutes a place where gestures of friendship were made and inscribed by individuals, leaving behind with them the most intimate trace of personhood, their own handwriting."

Because the story itself is morcellated, just as the body of the female creature (the “patchwork girl”) at its center is, text and body are co-identified. This relationship places the reader into a role of needing to gather together the disjointed parts in an active process of piecing the story together. Mediated by clicks that can seem to lead anywhere, in contrast with the codex whose pages reach a defined endpoint with each turn, the body of this digital book interacts with the reader by making an explicit demand that it be made whole: “if you want to see the whole, you will have to sew me together yourself,” it says."

Using such instruments as a refracting telescope, sextant and quadrant--all of which he made himself--to make his observations, he produced countless views, maps and diagrams of the moon in his book. These were painstakingly described, drawn and engraved also by Hevelius himself. Hevelius made an instrument inside his book for his reader to use: a volvelle that calculates the moon’s orbital path when turning the wheel. The name of the device, volvelle, is derived from the Latin word “volvere” or “to turn,” and refers to both its wheel shape and its ability to be turned when the reader moves it. Created by attaching a circular piece of paper to at least one other wheel with a piece of thread, traditional volvelles allow computations to be made that concern the motion of planets by superimposing a wheel so it falls within fixed coordinates inscribed around the edges of each wheel. In this way volvelles function as paper computers, as well as two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional entities, such as the moon, moving through projected points in time and space with the aid of a reader’s hand."

As the book’s publisher puts it, the pictures inside are “equal to six dressed dolls.” In six hand-colored wood-engraved plates, Rose Merton tells the story of a young orphan who is lured away from her guardian aunt by a gypsy woman holding a spinning wheel. That this wheel is the one element of the book that can be made to move by pulling a tab attached to it suggests its centrality to the story. Without Rose’s susceptibility to its novelty as a wheel that creates an optical illusion when it is turned, the operative turn in her fortune that forms the basis of the story would not have been made. PARAGRAPH The reader identifies with Rose by being similarly entranced by the book’s novel elements, and is compelled to follow the heroine through her trial, rescue and eventual return to safety. The colorful fabric pieces that comprise Rose’s dresses promote not only a sense of interactive tactility to the reading experience but also import elements of the “real world” into a make-believe one. While the depictions of Rose might be construed as paper doll-like forms, they are distinct from paper dolls (such as the well-known The History of Little Fanny, 1810). Unremovable from the book’s pages, she is situated in a represented world, against a backdrop of different landscapes, milieus, and other people. Moreover, while her dress is affixed to her as with paper dolls, it is not removable either."

Whereas earlier flap books comprised engraved illustrations, this one uses tinted lithographs for its illustrations (the illustrator, William Ludwell Sheppard, was a noted artist). Old Mother Hubbard is the 4th in the 6-part Mother Goose Series published by G.W. Carleton in the late 1870s. Carleton referred to its lithographs as “magic colored pictures.” PARAGRAPH Like the other books in the series, Old Mother Hubbard is full of violent verse and images that appear inconsistent with literature considered appropriate for young readers, the apparent intended audience. Verses in the book for instance refer to “John O’Gudgeon” the “wild man” who “whipt his children now and then,” making them “dance.” The effect of unexpected horror and subversion is accentuated by the book’s format, which requires readers to pick up the flap whose front makes up one image to reveal another lying underneath. The metamorphic flap page selection exhibited shows on the outer flap Old Mother Hubbard leaving the house she shares with a dog to go to the bakery. When lifting the flap, she is shown returning home to find the dog dead. With the flick of a wrist and turning of a flap page, the narrative expands, progresses and mutates visually, textually and kinetically."
ibx18_denzer_trifold,Ninety One at Sixty Ninth: Twenty Three Poems,"Denzer, Ben",New York,2020,Uncataloged,Turn,"This artist’s book by artist and designer Ben Denzer, which compiles poems by Sidney Offit (1928 - ), defamiliarizes the spatial mechanics of opening and reading a book by experimenting with paper folds and page order. Looking at first glance like a piece of ephemera from everyday life, a gatefold promotional pamphlet with a stapled binding that one might receive in the mail or pick up at a gallery or museum, this book is in fact a hand-bound paper puzzle. Through the simple maneuver of using pamphlet stitch to create a binding for folded leaves of paper along each end of the trifold cover, the book turns reading into a multi-directional experience. The codex model of reading from front to back or back to front is disrupted; Denzer’s numbering system necessitates reading pages from one end to another in order to proceed sequentially. Each page turn becomes an act of unfolding or unwrapping in order to reach the last poem, which is placed on the center panel. Closing the book necessitates an act of layering each page from opposite ends on top of the other to return the pages to their original order. Such structural quirks and witticisms make one even more aware of the actions made possible by the standard modern book format, including the random access it allows, as opposed to the sequential access (akin to a scroll) necessitated by the gatefold structure of Denzer’s book. Herein lies the paradox of this artist’s book: the playfulness of its inventive structure calls attention to the fixed conventions of the modern codex format while at the same revealing the inherent flexibility of its structure."

First published in Italian in 1544, the Commentarii was the preeminent botanical reference work during its time period; 32,000 copies of the earlier edition were sold. Mattioli (1501-1577), like all Italian botanists at the time, was a devoted student of the classical Greek text De material medica libri quinque by the physician, botanist and pharmacologist Dioscorides (c. 40-90 AD). Though its title presents him as a “commentator” on Dioscorides’s study, he made original contributions too and augmented Discorides’s 800 plant compendium by including every plant known to him. Many of these were reported to him by friends and acquaintances who traveled to distant countries, like the Flemish herbalist and diplomat to the Ottman Empire, Busbecq (1522-1592), and made botanical drawings in Turkey for Mattioli. PARAGRAPH The stunning woodcuts (made by Giorio Liberale and Wolfgang Meyerpack) appearing in this edition are original to it. Some are hand-colored, a practice of interacting with the book’s prints that might have been undertaken by the book owner or by print shop workers. A vivid indicator that this book was used arises in the pressed plant leaves that appear throughout this folio sized volume. The pressed plant suggests the reader not only spent time turning the pages of this heavy and large book, but also studied them closely. The reader also carried the information conveyed by Mattioli and those he in turn was informed by inside his mind and found specimens of the same plants within his own immediate environments. By collocating the real plant against the one described and illustrated in Mattioli’s plant book, the reader brought his world into direct contact with the one embodied by print."

The leaves of alder tree, for instance, “put to the bare feet gauled with travelling,” are recommended for being “very refreshing.” According to the author, John Archer (fl. 1660-1684), King Charles II’s court physician, this book, a follow-up to his earlier Every Man his own Doctor (1671), seeks to turn readers “in short time” into “Competent Herbalist.” Its “brevity” was intended to make the book “more portable” and “more useful, as a Vade Mecum” (“go with me” in Latin) or reference book. PARAGRAPH The owner of this copy allowed it to function even more as a vade mecum by creating a meticulously organized index on several blank leaves inserted at the back of the book. The terms in the index are of such wide-ranging and general ailments as “cough,” “cramp,” “bruises,” “belly ach,” “astma,” “gout,” “fatnesse,” “baldneses,” “dissentary.” By extracting the pertinent topics from each herb entry and compiling them alphabetically with corresponding page numbers in an index, the book owner mapped out the spaces of the book in terms of his own needs and made them easy to find. In this way the creation of an index was the operative step taken to turn Archer’s book decisively from an object to be read to an object to be used and consulted frequently. Given the comprehensiveness and density of the index, it is clear the book was subject to great care, both as an object of reading and an object of use in the owner’s daily life.

The headings on the wheel denote the arrival of the new moon, which marks the start of the Jewish month, and the cycle of the sun. Whereas calendars appear in general to be a “convenient way to coordinate human movements with natural time,” Elisheva Carlebach points out, the Sefer ‘Evronot demonstrates that calendars have different methods for doing so that are culturally and historically based.

This mid eighteenth-century example example from England has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone Mini or small smartphone. The name “horn book” derives from the transparent sheet of animal (sheep, ox or cow) horn used to protect the paper or parchment on which the letters of the alphabet, vowels and numbers are written. The structure of the “book” in this way bears more similarities with a tablet or phone window than a codex. The hook at the end of the paddle handle allowed the child to attach the hornbook to a girdle worn around the waist. Not only did this prevent the hornbook from getting misplaced, but also gave it a physically intimate status as a tool for helping the child to memorize the alphabet."
ibx25_ames_almanack,"An Astronomical Diary, or Almanack for the Year of our Lord Christ 1769","Ames, Nathaniel",Boston,1769,https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph002364398,Use,"This American eighteenth-century almanac or pocket diary represents a print genre that had first begun appearing in England in the mid-sixteenth century, and enjoyed immense popularity as cheap and ephemeral book items. They were filled with information presented in charts meant to help one plan, make decisions or take particular actions in their day-to-day activities, including mercantile ones. The centerpiece of these almanacs were the monthly calendars with information pertaining to different topics, including historical events, the weather, holidays, phases of the moon, and astrology. The back of this almanac includes a table of roads from Boston to other New England cities, indicating the extent to which this book genre was meant to be carried throughout one’s daily journeys. PARAGRAPH The pocket diary was worn on the body of its owner, carried in his pocket. In consequence, the body of the unbound volume developed wear. The cover’s paper is tattered and creased. Almanacs also bear the marks of their owners’ activities and existence in whatever blank space could be found inside them, or made to have inside them, with the help of printers adding blank sheets when requested by customers. Here, its owner writes about his location on the page opening for the months of August and September: “From my own Appartment from May 1769 to Septembr in the same year.” The appearance of handwriting on the almanac pages creates a striking image of manuscript interacting with print, and of individual selfhood finding a space for itself in a generic setting."
