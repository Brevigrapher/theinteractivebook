Whereas earlier flap books used engraved illustrations, this one indicates its relative modernity by using tinted lithographs for its illustrations (William Ludwell Sheppard, the illustrator, was a noted artist). <i>Old Mother Hubbard</i> is the 4th in the 6-part Mother Goose Series published by G.W. Carleton in the late 1870s. Carleton referred to its lithographs as “magic colored pictures.” </p><p> Like the other books in the series, <i>Old Mother Hubbard</i> presents violent verse and images that appear inconsistent with literature considered appropriate for young readers, the apparent intended audience. Verses in the book for instance refer to “John O’Gudgeon” the “wild man” who “whipt his children now and then,” making them “dance.” The effect of unexpected horror and subversion is accentuated by the book’s format, which requires readers to lift the flap whose front makes up one image to reveal another lying underneath depicting the next action. One of the metamorphic flap pages exhibited shows on the outer flap Old Mother Hubbard leaving the house she shares with a dog to go to the bakery. When lifting the flap, she is seen returning home to find the dog dead. With the flick of a wrist and turning of a flap page, the narrative expands, progresses and mutates visually, textually and kinetically.</p>",15,ibx_item,ibx,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx17_mother_hubbard_motherhubbard1/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx17_mother_hubbard_motherhubbard1/full/1140,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx17_mother_hubbard_motherhubbard1/full/501,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx17_mother_hubbard_motherhubbard1/full/90,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/ibx17_mother_hubbard/manifest.json

These were painstakingly described, drawn and engraved also by Hevelius himself. Hevelius made an instrument inside his book for his reader to use: a volvelle that calculates the moon’s orbital path when turning the wheel. The name of the device is derived from the Latin word “volvere” or “to turn,” and refers to both its wheel shape and its ability to be turned when the reader manipulates it. Created by attaching a circular piece of paper to at least one other wheel with a piece of thread, traditional volvelles allow computations to be made that concern the motions of planets by superimposing a wheel so it falls within fixed coordinates inscribed around the edges of each wheel. In this way volvelles function as paper computers, as well as two-dimensional representations of such three-dimensional entities as the moon, as it is made to appear to move through projected points in time and space with the aid of a reader’s hand.",12,ibx_item,ibx,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx14_hevelius_hevelius1/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx14_hevelius_hevelius1/full/1140,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx14_hevelius_hevelius1/full/501,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx14_hevelius_hevelius1/full/90,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/ibx14_hevelius/manifest.json

The leaves of alder tree, for instance, “put to the bare feet gauled with travelling,” are recommended for being “very refreshing.” According to the author, John Archer (fl. 1660-1684), King Charles II’s court physician, this book, a follow-up to his earlier <i>Every Man his own Doctor</i> (1671), seeks to turn readers “in short time” into “Competent Herbalist.” Its “brevity” was intended to make the book “more portable” and “more useful, as a <i>Vade Mecum</i>” (“go with me” in Latin) or reference book.</p><p>The owner of this copy, apparently Charles Wealey (according to the inscribed title page), allowed it to function even more as a vade mecum by creating a meticulously organized index on several blank leaves inserted at the back of the book. The terms in the index are of such wide-ranging and general ailments as “cough,” “cramp,” “bruises,” “belly ach,” “astma,” “gout,” “fatnesse,” “baldneses,” “dissentary.” By extracting the pertinent topics from each herb entry and compiling them alphabetically with corresponding page numbers in an index, the book owner mapped out the spaces of the book in terms of his own needs and made them easy to find. In this way the creation of an index was the operative step taken to turn Archer’s book decisively from an object to be read to an object to be consulted frequently. Given the comprehensiveness and density of the index, it is clear the book was subject to great care, both as an object of reading and an object of use in the owner’s daily life. As a soiled and worn volume, it apparently went where the owner did indeed.</p>",20,ibx_item,ibx,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx21_archer_archer1/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx21_archer_archer1/full/1140,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx21_archer_archer1/full/501,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx21_archer_archer1/full/90,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/ibx21_archer/manifest.json

Unlike inserted foldouts typically used for extra-illustration, these small prints fit well within the boundaries of the book’s original pages as well as the novel’s storyline.

It serves as a uniquely interactive form of book in its use of perishable and edible material for its pages. The condition of the cheese slices, despite being filled with preservatives, is highly changeable and unstable. While all materials decay over time, including paper and leather, perishable ones do so at an accelerated rate and are highly susceptible to the temperature and humidity of their environment, especially when kept unrefrigerated. The brownish mold spots emerging in more and more areas of each page ensure that the book’s composition changes and looks markedly altered over time. The effects are mutual and thus highly interactive as well as organic; increased biological growth on its body in response to environmental factors leads in turn to the book of cheese slices posing a threat of contamination to the objects surrounding it.

Because the story itself is morcellated, just as the body of the female creature (the “patchwork girl”) at its center is, text and body are co-identified. This relationship places the reader in a role of needing to gather together the disjointed parts of the narrative through the patchwork girl’s body. Mediated by clicks of a mouse or trackpad that can seem to lead anywhere in space, in contrast with the codex whose pages reach a defined endpoint with each turn, the body of this digital book interacts with the reader by voicing the demand: “if you want to see the whole, you will have to sew me together yourself.”.

Though its title presents him as a “commentator” on Dioscorides’s study, Mattioli made original contributions too and augmented Discorides’s 800 plant compendium by including every plant known to him.

That this wheel is the one element of the book which can be made to move by pulling a tab attached to it suggests its centrality to the story. Without Rose’s susceptibility to its novelty as a wheel that creates an optical illusion when it is in motion, the operative turn in her fortune that forms the basis of the story would not have been made.</p><p>The reader identifies with Rose by being similarly entranced by the book’s novel elements, and is compelled to follow the heroine through her trial, rescue and eventual return to safety. The colorful fabric pieces that comprise Rose’s dresses promote not only a sense of interactive tactility in the reading experience but also import elements of the “real world” into a make-believe one. While the depictions of Rose might be construed as paper doll-like forms, they are distinct from traditional paper dolls (such as the well-known <i>The History of Little Fanny</i>, 1810). Unremovable from the book’s pages, she is situated in a represented world with a backdrop of different landscapes, milieus, and other people.

Predecessors of this type of manuscript book include medieval medical recipe books known as “receptaria” used in monasteries as well as miscellanies and commonplace books, of which the recipe book is a type. Recorded in a neat and meticulous hand, the recipes are for both medicine and food. Smith organized her notebook in a deliberate fashion, devoting (as others did) the first half to medicinal recipes and the second half to food recipes. The words “A drinke for the cough of the lungs” begin the medicinal recipe section and “To make sugar cakes” begin the food recipe section. In accordance with other recipe books from the same period, a blank page and a half separate the two halves, suggesting Smith filled each half simultaneously as she encountered each type of recipe.</p><p>The words “Martha Smith her booke,” with Smith’s name in extra large letters, appear on the first page of the notebook. This indubitable mark of ownership is also a common sight in notebooks of the period. Books of this nature serve as repositories for the self and are a form of life writing. They are sites in which information useful for domestic life encountered and chosen by the notebook creator are carefully gathered and kept, ready to be consulted when needed by her. Scraps of paper with additional medicinal recipes are scribbled on them and tucked at the back of the notebook written in a different hand. A second name, Emily E. Bleecky, inscribed beneath Smith’s on the title page, shows a member of a later generation used Smith’s collection of recipes and incorporated them into her life as well.</p>",09,ibx_item,ibx,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx10_smith_martha_smithmartha1/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx10_smith_martha_smithmartha1/full/1140,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx10_smith_martha_smithmartha1/full/501,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx10_smith_martha_smithmartha1/full/90,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/ibx10_smith_martha/manifest.json

His <i>Icones</i> consists of two parts: the first is a gallery of notable religious figures who contributed to the Reformation, including Luther, Calvin and Erasmus. Presented in woodcut portraits and brief biographies, the gallery invites interaction by leaving frames blank for figures whose portraits are not available at the time, but will be available after the book’s publication. Interestingly the backs of the engravings cut out and pasted in by the reader reveal that they were cut out of other books published close to the same time period. This method of adding prints from other source establish this copy of <i>Icones</i> is extra-illustrated, as other items in this exhibition are (see <a href=https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx3_camden/>Camden</a>, <a href=""https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx4_stow/"">Stow</a>, and <a href=""https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx5_Radcliffe/"">Radcliffe</a>). Additional scraps of paper are attached to the engravings and empty engraved frames and are filled with sketches made by one of the book’s owners copying an extant portrait of a distinguished religious reformer.</p><p>The second portion of the book presents the 44 emblems that make <i>Icones</i> a notable example of the early modern emblem book genre. Emblem books set words and images into interplay with each other by presenting a mysterious visual icon or image with an accompanying epigram or motto. While the first section of the book, with its visual parade of illustrious religious leaders, appears disconnected from the emblems, the first few, which present images of frames with landscapes that surround empty spaces in which a circle floats, suggest what the connection might be. The epigram beneath the first emblem presents its circle as a picture both of eternal life and God’s perfection, suggesting that by focusing on the image in front of them, and following the subsequent emblems to the end, the reader might enact the circular path of eternity. Through applying the idea of God’s eternity to one’s own life, one might place oneself inside the space of the circle that is in turn surrounded by a frame. In this way the emblem book portion of <i>Icones</i> picks up on the interactive possibilities of its portraits, which similarly invite the reader’s “input” by leaving some of its spaces intentionally blank for their own reflection.</p>",01,ibx_item,ibx,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx2_beze_beze1/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx2_beze_beze1/full/1140,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx2_beze_beze1/full/501,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx2_beze_beze1/full/90,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/ibx2_beze/manifest.json

As the name implies, pressure printing is a printmaking technique where variation in the pressure applied to paper and an inked printing surface produces an image. Each act of pressure printing creates a positive print and a negative print.</p><p>Whereas the positive print is the image created when applying pressure directly onto the paper with the inked printing surface behind it, the negative print is created when a new print is made from pressing paper onto the “latent image” left behind on the printing surface by the positive print. A relief surface made from a blind impression (an impression without ink) on the paper with the wood type’s top and bottom produces the variable pressure necessary to create an image. As Mellis puts it, the process, which he calls “auto-pressure printing” turns a piece of wood type from a relief (raised) surface to a planographic (flat) one.</p><p>Each print in the box represents a different turn in the printing experiment, with notations representing which part of the wood block, on what axis the paper was flipped, and at what degree the block was rotated. Further notations indicate the side of the block that took ink and the last impression. Notation brackets [ ] denote positive auto-pressure printing, and parentheses ( ) denote negative auto-pressure printing. The prints exhibited, R[V], R(V), R'(V) and R’R<sub>2</sub>R(V), show a visual narrative of the merging, exchanging and reversal of shapes, textures and patterns that take place through the simple but calculated operations of turning and pressing paper against a single inked block of wood type.</p>",16,ibx_item,ibx,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx13_mellis_mellis1/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx13_mellis_mellis1/full/1140,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx13_mellis_mellis1/full/501,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx13_mellis_mellis1/full/90,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/ibx13_mellis/manifest.json

Looking at first glance like a piece of ephemera from everyday life, a gatefold promotional pamphlet with a stapled binding that one might receive in the mail or pick up at a gallery or museum, this book is in fact a hand-bound paper puzzle.</p><p>Through the simple maneuver of using pamphlet stitch to create a binding for folded leaves of paper along each end of the trifold cover, the book turns reading into a multi-directional experience. The codex model of reading from front to back or back to front is disrupted; Denzer’s numbering system necessitates reading pages from one end to another in order to proceed sequentially. Each page turn becomes an act of unfolding or unwrapping in order to reach the last poem, which is placed on the center panel. Closing the book necessitates an act of layering each page from opposite ends on top of the other to return the pages to their original order.</p><p>Such structural quirks and witticisms make one even more aware of the actions made possible by the standard modern book format, including the random access it allows, as opposed to the sequential access (akin to a scroll) necessitated by the gatefold structure of Denzer’s book. Herein lies the paradox of this artist’s book: the playfulness of its inventive structure calls attention to the fixed conventions of the modern codex format while at the same revealing the inherent flexibility of its structure.</p>",18,ibx_item,ibx,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx18_denzer_trifold_denzer_trifold1/full/250,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx18_denzer_trifold_denzer_trifold1/full/1140,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx18_denzer_trifold_denzer_trifold1/full/501,/0/default.jpg","/img/derivatives/iiif/images/ibx18_denzer_trifold_denzer_trifold1/full/90,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/ibx18_denzer_trifold/manifest.json

The centerpiece of these almanacs were the monthly calendars with information pertaining to different topics, including historical events, the weather, holidays, phases of the moon, and astrology.
