### About the Curator

**[Julie Park](http://www.juliepark.space)**, Bryn Mawr AB, Princeton PhD, UCLA MLIS, is Assistant Curator and Faculty Fellow of NYU Special Collections. She is an interdisciplinary scholar of eighteenth-century British literature, material and visual culture, and book history. Her book <i>My Dark Room</i> (forthcoming, University of Chicago Press), takes the camera obscura as a conceptual model for understanding the designs and experiences of interior spaces in 17th- and 18th-century England. At NYU she is researching and writing <i>Writing’s Maker</i>, a book on the materiality of life writing and self-inscription formats in the eighteenth century. She has been awarded many research awards, including long-term fellowships at the Folger Shakespeare Library and the Huntington Library. In 2020 she was the winner of the American Library Association’s Justin Winsor Library History Essay Prize.
