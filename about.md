### About the Curator

**[Julie Park](http://www.juliepark.space)**, Princeton PhD, UCLA MLIS, is Assistant Curator and Faculty Fellow of NYU Special Collections. An interdisciplinary scholar of literature, material and visual culture and book history, she is the author of <i>The Self and It</i> (Stanford University Press, 2010), editor of special issues for such journals as Word and Image (forthcoming) and <i>Eighteenth-Century Fiction</i>, and co-editor of <i>Organic Supplements</i> (University of Virginia Press, 2020). Her book <i>My Dark Room</i> (under contract, University of Chicago Press), takes the camera obscura as a conceptual model for understanding the designs and experiences of interior spaces in 17th- and 18th-century England. At NYU she is researching and writing <i>Writing’s Maker</i> , a book on the materiality of life writing and self-inscription formats in the eighteenth century, and teaches a book history seminar in the English department. She has been awarded many research awards, including long-term fellowships at the Folger Shakespeare Library and the Huntington Library. In 2020 she was the winner of the American Library Association’s Justin Winsor Library History Essay Prize for her essay on the infrastructure of the Los Angeles Central Public Library’s architectural design.
