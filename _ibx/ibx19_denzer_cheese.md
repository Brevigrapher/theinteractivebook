description: 'Artist and designer Ben Denzer''s book of American cheese slices challenges
  pre-conceived notions of what materials can be used to create the parts of a book.
  It serves as a uniquely interactive form of book in its use of perishable and edible
  material for its pages. The condition of the cheese slices, despite being filled
  with preservatives, is highly changeable and unstable. While all materials decay
  over time, including paper and leather, perishable ones do so at an accelerated
  rate and are highly susceptible to the temperature and humidity of their environment,
  especially when kept unrefrigerated. The brownish mold spots emerging in more and
  more areas of each page ensure that the book''s composition changes and looks markedly
  altered over time. The effects are mutual and truly interactive; its increased biological
  growth in response to environmental factors leads to the book of cheese slices posing
  in turn a threat of contamination to the objects surrounding it. (See <a href="../ibx18_denzer_trifold/">
