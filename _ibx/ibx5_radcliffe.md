description: This copy of Ann Radcliffe’s novel A Sicilian Romance (1790) is unusual
  for being extra-illustrated, as the copy of Stow’s Survey HYPERLINK “SURVEY” in
  this exhibition is. Most commonly, extra-illustrated (supplemented with print illustrations
  from other sources) books are in large formats, and are devoted not to fiction,
  but to historical biography, antiquarian history and travel, or works by Shakespeare.
  Traditionally appearing in pocket sized, duodecimo format, eighteenth-century novels
  in contrast lacked the space for “holding” additional engraved prints, whose original
  sizes far exceed the dimensions of a standard novel. Yet the owner of this copy
  of Radcliffe’s novel inventively used miniature engravings--possibly cut out from
  another source--to fill in the bits of blank spaces at the end and beginning of
  chapters. PARAGRAPH The small pictures pasted into the novel by its owner depict
  picturesque landscape scenes that stir the imagination and correspond with scenes
  described in the narrative, such as ruined castles by the sea covered in overgrown
  ivy, and views of Italian volcanoes. Human figures from the Gothic era, from knights
  in armor riding horseback to a nun in a white habit frightened by an invisible visitor
  to her prayer chamber, might be identified as characters in the novel. Unlike inserted
  foldouts typically used for extra-illustration, these small prints fit well within
  the boundaries of the book’s original pages as well as the novel’s storyline. They
  draw the reader further into the Gothic world imagined by Radcliffe and offer a
  chance to see it realized in images, while at the same time turning the owner’s
  copy of the book into an individualized one.
