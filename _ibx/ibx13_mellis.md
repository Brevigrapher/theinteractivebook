description: '<p>Chicago-based book artist Daniel Mellis took a single piece of wood
  type, a thirty pica Clarendon R, and explored "the graphic possibilities" made available
  when using it in a "restricted set of operations": positive and negative auto-pressure
  printing with a single inked impression. As the name implies, pressure printing
  is a printmaking technique where variation in the pressure applied to paper and
  an inked printing surface produces an image. Each act of pressure printing creates
  a positive print and a negative print. Whereas the positive print is the image created
  when applying pressure directly onto the paper with the inked printing surface behind
  it, the negative print is created when a new print is made from pressing paper onto
  the "latent image" left behind on the printing surface by the positive print. A
  relief surface made from a blind impression (an impression without ink) on the paper
  with the wood type''s top and bottom produces the variable pressure necessary to
  create an image. As Mellis puts it, the process, which he calls "auto-pressure printing"
  turns a piece of wood type from a relief (raised)surface to a planographic (flat)
  one.</p><p>Each print in the box represents a different turn in the printing experiment,
  with notations representing which part of the wood block, on what axis the paper
  was flipped, and at what degree the block was rotated. Further notations indicate
  the side of the block that took ink and the last impression. Notation brackets [
  ] denote positive auto-pressure printing, and parentheses ( ) denote negative auto-pressure
  printing. The prints exhibited, R(V), R[V] and R''R2R(V), show a visual narrative
  of the merging, exchanging and reversing of shapes, textures and patterns that take
  place through the simple but calculated maneuvers of turning and pressing paper
  against a single inked block of wood type.</p>'
