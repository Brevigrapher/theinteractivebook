description: "<p><i>Oracle</i>, as a fan, is a fashion accessory meant to regulate
  bodily and ambient temperature, as well as an interactive game and a book-like object.
  Identifying itself as a “book,” it persuasively comprises critical elements of one.
  It is a folded composite object based on paper, combines word and image in its representational
  system, uses the print medium, stores multiple pieces of information in one compact
  space, and is held in the hand, close to the body. It is “bound” on one end. In
  order to exploit its full function, one has to “open” it. The paper portion of the
  fan on which words and images are presented is called a “leaf,” and has a recto
  and verso side. The two sides of this particular fan are interdependent and require
  a turn of its leaf to reveal their shared meaning.</p><p>The element on which the
  game pivots is the wheel depicted on the recto. Numbers correspond to such questions
  as “Whether the Dream be true” or “Whether one is to get Riches.” The fan owner’s
  companion, keeping the number of the question in mind, pricks with a pin one of
  the numbers on the wheel. This number in turn corresponds with one of the deities–Jupiter,
  Juno, Apollo, Diana, Mars, Venus, Bacchus, Ceres, Mercury, and Minerva–residing
  in individual columns on the verso side of the fan. Within each column, a numbered
  answer for each numbered question is provided. Through the play of chance and fortune,
  different story lines unfold for a querent, with the outcome of her story revealed
  with the turn of a hand-held printed object.</p>"
