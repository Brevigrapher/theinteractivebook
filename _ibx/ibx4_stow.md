description: This copy of John Stow’s Survey of London, as many extra-illustrated
  books do, includes several foldout prints. Stow (1525-1605), like William Camden
  (author of Britannia HYPERLINK "BRITANNIA"), was a 16th-century antiquarian whose
  Survey accomplished a similar goal of providing a historical account of a topographical
  region or area. In Stow’s case, the target area was London. Essentially a travel
  guide, his Survey was compiled from archival material related to London’s architectural
  monuments and social activities. It was updated several times. The exhibition features
  the eighteenth-century edition of John Strype (1643-1737), which came endowed with
  contemporary maps and plates and was produced in lavish folio format. PARAGRAPH
  By extra-illustrating this copy of the book, or making it more visually bountiful
  by adding new plates, the owner was participating in a pastime that was popular
  for readers from the 1770s to the early 20th century. In doing so, the owner added
  new meaning to the book. Not a passive reader of Stow’s and Strype’s guided tours
  of London’s streets, the owner created their own journey through London with the
  materials of their personal print collection, creating more stopping points with
  new prints to unfold along the way.
