description: <p>Like many other extra-illustrated (supplemented with print illustrations
  from other sources) books, this copy of John Stow's <i>Survey of London</i> includes
  several foldout prints. Stow (1525-1605), like William Camden (author of <a href="../ibx3_camden/">Britannia</a>),
  was a sixteenth-century antiquarian whose <i>Survey</i> accomplished a similar goal
  of providing a historical account of a topographical region or area. In Stow's case,
  the target area was London. Essentially a travel guide, his <i>Survey</i> was compiled
  from archival material related to London's architectural monuments and social activities.
  It was updated several times. The exhibition features the eighteenth-century edition
  of John Strype (1643-1737), which came endowed with contemporary maps and plates
  and was produced in a lavish folio format.</p><p>By extra-illustrating this copy
  of the book, or making it more visually bountiful with added new plates, the owner
  was participating in a pastime that was popular for readers from the 1770s to the
  early twentieth century. In doing so, the owner added new meaning to the book. Not
  a passive reader of Stow's and Strype's guided tours of London's streets, the owner
  created their own journey through London with the materials of their personal print
  collection, creating more stopping points with new prints to unfold along the way.</p>
