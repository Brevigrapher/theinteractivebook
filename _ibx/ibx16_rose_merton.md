description: With its movable element and pieces of real fabric used to depict the
  heroine’s dress, this children’s book is a hybrid book and toy. As the book’s publisher
  puts it, the pictures inside are “equal to six dressed dolls.” In six hand-colored
  wood-engraved plates, Rose Merton tells the story of a young orphan who is lured
  away from her guardian aunt by a gypsy woman holding a spinning wheel. That this
  wheel is the one element of the book that can be made to move by pulling a tab attached
  to it suggests its centrality to the story. Without Rose’s susceptibility to its
  novelty as a wheel that creates an optical illusion when it is turned, the operative
  turn in her fortune that forms the basis of the story would not have been made.
  PARAGRAPH The reader identifies with Rose by being similarly entranced by the book’s
  novel elements, and is compelled to follow the heroine through her trial, rescue
  and eventual return to safety. The colorful fabric pieces that comprise Rose’s dresses
  promote not only a sense of interactive tactility to the reading experience but
  also import elements of the “real world” into a make-believe one. While the depictions
  of Rose might be construed as paper doll-like forms, they are distinct from paper
  dolls (such as the well-known The History of Little Fanny, 1810). Unremovable from
  the book’s pages, she is situated in a represented world, against a backdrop of
  different landscapes, milieus, and other people. Moreover, while her dress is affixed
  to her as with paper dolls, it is not removable either.
