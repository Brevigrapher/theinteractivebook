description: "<p>With its movable element and pieces of real fabric used to depict
  the heroine’s dress, this children’s book is a hybrid book and toy. As the book’s
  publisher puts it, the pictures inside are “equal to six dressed dolls.” In six
  hand-colored wood-engraved plates, <i>Rose Merton</i> tells the story of a young
  orphan who is lured away from her guardian aunt by a Romani woman identified as
  a “Gipsy woman” holding a spinning multi-colored wheel toy. That this wheel is the
  one element of the book which can be made to move by pulling a tab attached to it
  suggests its centrality to the story. Without Rose’s susceptibility to its novelty
  as a wheel that creates an optical illusion when it is in motion, the operative
  turn in her fortune that forms the basis of the story would not have been made.</p><p>The
  reader identifies with Rose by being similarly entranced by the book’s novel elements,
  and is compelled to follow the heroine through her trial, rescue and eventual return
  to safety. The colorful fabric pieces that comprise Rose’s dresses promote not only
  a sense of interactive tactility in the reading experience but also import elements
  of the “real world” into a make-believe one. While the depictions of Rose might
  be construed as paper doll-like forms, they are distinct from traditional paper
  dolls (such as the well-known <i>The History of Little Fanny</i>, 1810). Unremovable
  from the book’s pages, she is situated in a represented world with a backdrop of
  different landscapes, milieus, and other people. And while her dress is affixed
  to her as it is with paper dolls, it can not be removed. Mobility is instead found
  in the way Rose is moved through a story with different dresses to wear on each
  page that depicts her story.</p>"
