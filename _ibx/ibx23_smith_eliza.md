description: "<p>Eliza Smith was a cook for “fashionable and noble families” (as she
  puts it ) who compiled the recipes she used during the thirty plus years she was
  employed by them. The recipes are suited to the “English constitutions, and English
  palates.” That is, they are “wholsome,” practical, and “easy to be performed.” The
  fact that the book went through 20 editions in 50 years indicates that Smith’s recipes
  were as approved of by the public as they were by her employers. Emphasis is placed
  on the replicability of the recipes and the fact that they come from a person who
  had used them herself: “What I present the world with, is the product of my own
  experience,” Smith declares. Furthermore the book’s graphic design elements allow
  readers to reproduce easily the models presented in the book by offering copper
  plate engraved foldout diagrams of table settings.</p> <p>The frontispiece for the
  book, which depicts a group of largely female servants working together in the kitchen
  of a great house, reinforces the notion that the recipes come from direct experience.
  The physical conditions of the <a href=“https://library.nyu.edu/persistent/lcn/nyu_aleph001006758?institution=NYU&persistent”>
  12th edition copy</a>, with a medicinal recipe clipped out of one of its pages (shown),
  dog ears, stains and traces of handwriting trials on others, demonstrates the book
  was as much used for cooking as for quotidian living by an early owner</p>."
