description: This book is a German translation of Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s Commentarii
  in sex libros Pedacii Dioscoridis. First published in Italian in 1544, the Commentarii
  was the preeminent botanical reference work during its time period; 32,000 copies
  of the earlier edition were sold. Mattioli (1501-1577), like all Italian botanists
  at the time, was a devoted student of the classical Greek text De material medica
  libri quinque by the physician, botanist and pharmacologist Dioscorides (c. 40-90
  AD). Though its title presents him as a “commentator” on Dioscorides’s study, he
  made original contributions too and augmented Discorides’s 800 plant compendium
  by including every plant known to him. Many of these were reported to him by friends
  and acquaintances who traveled to distant countries, like the Flemish herbalist
  and diplomat to the Ottman Empire, Busbecq (1522-1592), and made botanical drawings
  in Turkey for Mattioli. PARAGRAPH The stunning woodcuts (made by Giorio Liberale
  and Wolfgang Meyerpack) appearing in this edition are original to it. Some are hand-colored,
  a practice of interacting with the book’s prints that might have been undertaken
  by the book owner or by print shop workers. A vivid indicator that this book was
  used arises in the pressed plant leaves that appear throughout this folio sized
  volume. The pressed plant suggests the reader not only spent time turning the pages
  of this heavy and large book, but also studied them closely. The reader also carried
  the information conveyed by Mattioli and those he in turn was informed by inside
  his mind and found specimens of the same plants within his own immediate environments.
  By collocating the real plant against the one described and illustrated in Mattioli’s
  plant book, the reader brought his world into direct contact with the one embodied
  by print.
