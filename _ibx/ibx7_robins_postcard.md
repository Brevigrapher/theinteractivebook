description: This card sent by American-born writer, actress and suffragist Elizabeth
  Robins (1862-1952), a resident of England, from Alaska in 1900 to Florence Bell
  in Yorkshire, England exemplifies an early form of postcard known as a notecard.
  Rather than a picture, the front side of the card is reserved for the address of
  the recipient, and the verso offers space for a message. Meant to be filled in by
  the sender and read by a distant party, the proto-postcard format provides a fixed
  structure for concisely formulated personal expressions of the senderâ€™s own choosing.
  In Alaska looking for her missing brother in the gold rush camps, Robins used the
  modern medium of the postcard to convey to her friend the most immediate and everyday
  details from an extraordinary episode in her remarkable life.
