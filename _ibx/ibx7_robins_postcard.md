description: American-born actress, writer, and suffragist Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952),
  visiting Alaska from England, in 1900. wrote to Florence Bell in Yorkshire, England
  on an early form of postcard known as a notecard. Rather than a picture, the front
  side of the card is reserved for the address of the recipient, and the verso offers
  space for a message. Meant to be filled in by the sender and read by a distant party,
  the proto-postcard format provides a fixed structure for concisely formulated expressions
  of the sender's own choosing. In Alaska looking for her missing brother in the gold
  rush camps, Robins used the modern medium of the postcard to convey to her friend
  in a small space the most immediate and everyday details from an extraordinary episode
  in her remarkable life.
