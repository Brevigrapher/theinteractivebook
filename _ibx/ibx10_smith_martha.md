description: "<p>Martha Smith’s book exemplifies one of the most prevalent forms of
  manuscript collection in the early modern period (ca. 1550-1800): the recipe book.
  Predecessors of this type of manuscript book include medieval medical recipe books
  known as “receptaria” used in monasteries as well as miscellanies and commonplace
  books, of which the recipe book is a type. Recorded in a neat and meticulous hand,
  the recipes are for both medicine and food. Smith organized her notebook in a deliberate
  fashion, devoting (as others did) the first half to medicinal recipes and the second
  half to food recipes. The words “A drinke for the cough of the lungs” begin the
  medicinal recipe section and “To make sugar cakes” begin the food recipe section.
  In accordance with other recipe books from the same period, a blank page and a half
  separate the two halves, suggesting Smith filled each half simultaneously as she
  encountered each type of recipe.</p><p>The words “Martha Smith her booke,” with
  Smith’s name in extra large letters, appear on the first page of the notebook. This
  indubitable mark of ownership is also a common sight in notebooks of the period.
  Books of this nature serve as repositories for the self and are a form of life writing.
  They are sites in which information useful for domestic life encountered and chosen
  by the notebook creator are carefully gathered and kept, ready to be consulted when
  needed by her. Scraps of paper with additional medicinal recipes are scribbled on
  them and tucked at the back of the notebook written in a different hand. A second
  name, Emily E. Bleecky, inscribed beneath Smith’s on the title page, shows a member
  of a later generation used Smith’s collection of recipes and incorporated them into
  her life as well.</p>"
