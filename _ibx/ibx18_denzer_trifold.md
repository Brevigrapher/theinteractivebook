description: 'This artist’s book by artist and designer Ben Denzer, which compiles
  poems by Sidney Offit (1928 - ), defamiliarizes the spatial mechanics of opening
  and reading a book by experimenting with paper folds and page order. Looking at
  first glance like a piece of ephemera from everyday life, a gatefold promotional
  pamphlet with a stapled binding that one might receive in the mail or pick up at
  a gallery or museum, this book is in fact a hand-bound paper puzzle. Through the
  simple maneuver of using pamphlet stitch to create a binding for folded leaves of
  paper along each end of the trifold cover, the book turns reading into a multi-directional
  experience. The codex model of reading from front to back or back to front is disrupted;
  Denzer’s numbering system necessitates reading pages from one end to another in
  order to proceed sequentially. Each page turn becomes an act of unfolding or unwrapping
  in order to reach the last poem, which is placed on the center panel. Closing the
  book necessitates an act of layering each page from opposite ends on top of the
  other to return the pages to their original order. Such structural quirks and witticisms
  make one even more aware of the actions made possible by the standard modern book
  format, including the random access it allows, as opposed to the sequential access
  (akin to a scroll) necessitated by the gatefold structure of Denzer’s book. Herein
  lies the paradox of this artist’s book: the playfulness of its inventive structure
  calls attention to the fixed conventions of the modern codex format while at the
  same revealing the inherent flexibility of its structure.'
