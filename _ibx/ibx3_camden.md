description: William Camden’s <i>Britannia</i> was first published in 1586. The 6th
  edition, published in 1607, was the first folio sized edition, as well as the first
  to include maps for this foundational antiquarian work. Camden (1551-1623) was pivotal
  in developing antiquarianism, a novel method of studying Britain’s ancient past
  that placed an emphasis on the direct study of its artifacts—coins, ruins, heraldry,
  inscriptions—as found in its different regions. Every graphic feature in this copy
  of the book was <a href=“https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx20_mattioli/”> filled
  by hand with color</a>, from printer’s ornaments and drop cap initials to maps and
  illustrations of antique coins and inscriptions. While it is difficult to determine
  whether the coloring was done professionally in the print shop or by an extremely
  skilled and diligent reader, the addition of color brings different interactive
  elements to the book. Filling in the book with a new element after its printing
  is one, and bringing the past to life with the enlivening properties of color is
  another.
