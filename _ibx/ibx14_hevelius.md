description: 'In 1647 Johannes Hevelius (1611-1687) published the first comprehensive
  atlas of the moon’s topography, <i>Selenographia</i>, the result of many years of
  labor. Using such instruments as a refracting telescope, sextant and quadrant—all
  of which he made himself—to make his observations, he produced countless views,
  maps and diagrams of the moon in his book. These were painstakingly described, drawn
  and engraved also by Hevelius himself. Hevelius made an instrument inside his book
  for his reader to use: a volvelle that calculates the moon’s orbital path when turning
  the wheel. The name of the device is derived from the Latin word “volvere” or “to
  turn,” and refers to both its wheel shape and its ability to be turned when the
  reader manipulates it. Created by attaching a circular piece of paper to at least
  one other wheel with a piece of thread, traditional volvelles allow computations
  to be made that concern the motions of planets by superimposing a wheel so it falls
  within fixed coordinates inscribed around the edges of each wheel. In this way volvelles
  function as paper computers, as well as two-dimensional representations of such
  three-dimensional entities as the moon, as it is made to appear to move through
  projected points in time and space with the aid of a reader’s hand.'
