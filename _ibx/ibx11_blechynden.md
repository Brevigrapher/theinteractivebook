description: This item, known as a friendship album, owned by Jane Harriet Blechynden
  (1806-1827), a young Anglo-Indian woman educated in England, is a form of commonplace
  book that was especially popular in the early nineteenth century—both in Britain
  and America. Composed by several hands but compiled by one person, this kind of
  notebook served as a repository for the taste, talent and viewpoints of a collective
  body of individual men and women. Consisting of drawings, poems, riddles and games,
  the entries of friendship albums were considered gifts by their inscriber. They
  also carried with them signs of their social status and education, as each entry
  was an opportunity to demonstrate one’s knowledge and accomplishments--such as knowledge
  of French--as well as elegance of handwriting. PARAGRAPH An object of private circulation,
  the book would be looked at, signed and filled in by family members (Blechynden’s
  sisters Emma and Sarah) and visitors to the compiler’s home, or would travel with
  her. Here, the term “commonplace” takes on new meaning as the book itself, a blank
  space that was progressively filled up by the people its owner interacted with and
  wanted to memorialize with the written and drawn products of their own hands. Each
  entertaining page constitutes a place where gestures of friendship were made and
  inscribed by individuals, leaving behind with them the most intimate trace of personhood,
  their own handwriting.
