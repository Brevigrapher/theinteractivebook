description: "<p>This manuscript item, known as a friendship album, owned by Jane
  Harriet Blechynden (1806-1827), a young Anglo-Indian woman educated in England,
  is a form of commonplace book that was especially popular in early nineteenth century
  Britain and America. Composed by several hands but compiled by one person, this
  kind of notebook served as a space for the taste, talent and viewpoints of a collective
  body of individual men and women. Consisting of drawings, poems, riddles and games,
  the entries of friendship albums were considered gifts by their inscriber. They
  also carried with them signs of their social status and education, as each entry
  was an opportunity to demonstrate one’s accomplishments–such as knowledge of French–as
  well as elegance of handwriting.</p><p>An object of private circulation, the book
  would be looked at, signed and filled in by family members (Blechynden’s sisters
  Emma and Sarah make appearances) and visitors to the compiler’s home, or would travel
  with her. Here, the term “commonplace” takes on new meaning as the book itself,
  a blank space that was progressively filled by the people its owner interacted with
  and wanted to memorialize with the written and drawn products of their own hands.
  Each entertaining page constitutes a place where gestures of friendship were made
  and inscribed by individuals, leaving behind with them the most intimate trace of
  personhood, their own handwriting.</p>"
