description: "<p>This copy of the first edition of Holinshed’s <i>Chronicles</i> displays
  the marks of its owner in the margins and on blank pages. A collaboratively written
  history of Britain, the <i>Chronicles</i> was used to inform English literary works
  of the Renaissance, including those of Marlowe, Spenser, and most famously Shakespeare.
  The marginalia throughout this copy includes whimsical drawings of men in contemporary
  Renaissance dress (ruffs and hats with large plumes) and pen trials in contemporary
  secretary hand.</p> <p>The owner made use of pages left entirely blank by filling
  it with his doodles and the products of his attempt to practice his penmanship and
  letter writing skills, including his sign-off. Presumably the owner’s name was “John
  Hatfeeld,” for two copies of the lines “At your honor’s commandement your obedient
  servant John Hatfeeld” appear. In these instances the owner is not producing the
  form of marginalia that scholar William Sherman describes in <i>Used Books</i> as
  “a glossarial note or commentary against a word or passage.” Instead he is filling
  up pages as he might fill up the spaces of his mind with thoughts and images as
  they occur to him. The owner made his mark on the book as much by commenting on
  the text and copying its characters as by turning its blank spaces into a repository
  for the free-flowing materials of his mind.</p>"
