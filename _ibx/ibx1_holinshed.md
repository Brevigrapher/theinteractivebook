description: This copy of the first edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles bears the marks
  of its owner in the margins and on blank pages. A collaboratively written history
  of Britain, the Chronicles was used to inform English literary works of the Renaissance,
  including those of Marlowe, Spenser, and most famously Shakespeare. The marginalia
  (marks made by the reader in the margins and other blank spaces of the text) throughout
  this copy includes whimsical drawings of men in contemporary Renaissance dress (ruffs
  and hats with large plumes) and writing in secretary hand reflecting on the text.
  PARAGRAPH The owner made use of pages left entirely blank by filling it with doodles
  and the products of his attempt to practice his penmanship and lines in letters,
  including his sign-off. Presumably the owner’s name was “John Hatfeeld,” for two
  copies of the lines “At your honor’s commandement your obedient servant John Hatfeeld”
  appear. In these instances the owner is not producing the form of marginalia that
  scholar William Sherman describes in Used Books as “a glossarial note or commentary
  against a word or passage.” Instead he is filling up pages as he might fill up the
  spaces of his mind with thoughts and images as they occur to him. The owner made
  his mark on the book as much by commenting on the text and copying its characters
  as by filling its blank spaces into a repository for the free flowing materials
  of his mind.
