description: 'The <i>Sefer ‘Evronot</i> is a Hebrew calendar book. The volvelles as
  well as hand diagrams and tables were some of the tools used not just for calculating
  and identifying pivotal dates and worshipping times for Jews, but also for ascertaining
  Christan holidays. This knowledge was a critical aid for protecting Jews from the
  danger posed by their having different worshipping times and habits from the dominant
  culture. The headings on the wheel denote the arrival of the new moon, which marks
  the start of the Jewish month, and the cycle of the sun. Whereas calendars appear
  in general to be a "convenient way to coordinate human movements with natural time,"
  Elisheva Carlebach points out, the <i>Sefer ‘Evronot</i> demonstrates that calendars
  have different methods for doing so that are culturally and historically shaped.
  The wheel, computing information with each push of a finger, demands interaction
  from the reader in order to yield knowledge not just to use but to live by.  '
