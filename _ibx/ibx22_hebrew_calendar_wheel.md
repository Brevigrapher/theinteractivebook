description: The book this volvelle appears in is known as a Sefer ‘Evronot, a Hebrew
  calendar book. The volvelle was one of the tools used not just for pivotal dates
  and worshipping times for Jews, but also for calculating such dates as Christan
  holidays. This knowledge was a critical aid for protecting Jews from the danger
  posed by their different worshipping times and habits from the dominant culture.
  The headings on the wheel denote the arrival of the new moon, which marks the start
  of the Jewish month, and the cycle of the sun. Whereas calendars appear in general
  to be a “convenient way to coordinate human movements with natural time,” Elisheva
  Carlebach points out, the Sefer ‘Evronot demonstrates that calendars have different
  methods for doing so that are culturally and historically based. The wheel demands
  interaction from the reader in order to yield the useful information that is computed
  with each push of the wheel by the finger.
