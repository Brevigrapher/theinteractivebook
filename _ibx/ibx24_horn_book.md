description: The alphabet, as literature scholar Patricia Crain puts it, is “the first
  step to literacy training.” Horn books had been used for teaching the alphabet since
  the fifteenth century and continued to be used until the nineteenth century, with
  little change to its design or function. This mid eighteenth-century example example
  from England has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone Mini or small smartphone.
  The name “horn book” derives from the transparent sheet of animal (sheep, ox or
  cow) horn used to protect the paper or parchment on which the letters of the alphabet,
  vowels and numbers are written. The structure of the “book” in this way bears more
  similarities with a tablet or phone window than a codex. The hook at the end of
  the paddle handle allowed the child to attach the hornbook to a girdle worn around
  the waist. Not only did this prevent the hornbook from getting misplaced, but also
  gave it a physically intimate status as a tool for helping the child to memorize
  the alphabet.
