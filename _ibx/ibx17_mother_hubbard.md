description: This late nineteenth-century children’s book is a later American example
  of the movable type of children’s book originating in mid-seventeenth century England
  and known as the metamorphic book, flap book, turn-up book, or harlequinade. Whereas
  earlier flap books comprised engraved illustrations, this one uses tinted lithographs
  for its illustrations (the illustrator, William Ludwell Sheppard, was a noted artist).
  Old Mother Hubbard is the 4th in the 6-part Mother Goose Series published by G.W.
  Carleton in the late 1870s. Carleton referred to its lithographs as “magic colored
  pictures.” PARAGRAPH Like the other books in the series, Old Mother Hubbard is full
  of violent verse and images that appear inconsistent with literature considered
  appropriate for young readers, the apparent intended audience. Verses in the book
  for instance refer to “John O’Gudgeon” the “wild man” who “whipt his children now
  and then,” making them “dance.” The effect of unexpected horror and subversion is
  accentuated by the book’s format, which requires readers to pick up the flap whose
  front makes up one image to reveal another lying underneath. The metamorphic flap
  page selection exhibited shows on the outer flap Old Mother Hubbard leaving the
  house she shares with a dog to go to the bakery. When lifting the flap, she is shown
  returning home to find the dog dead. With the flick of a wrist and turning of a
  flap page, the narrative expands, progresses and mutates visually, textually and
  kinetically.
