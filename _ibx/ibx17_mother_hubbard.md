description: '<p><i>Old Mother Hubbard: Magical Changes with Mother Goose Melodies</i>
  is a late nineteenth-century children''s book that exemplifies the type of movable
  children''s book originating in mid-seventeenth century England known as the metamorphic
  book, flap book, turn-up book, or harlequinade. Whereas earlier flap books used
  engraved illustrations, this one indicates its relative modernity by using tinted
  lithographs for its illustrations (William Ludwell Sheppard, the illustrator, was
  a noted artist). <i>Old Mother Hubbard</i> is the 4th in the 6-part Mother Goose
  Series published by G.W. Carleton in the late 1870s. Carleton referred to its lithographs
  as "magic colored pictures." </p><p> Like the other books in the series, <i>Old
  Mother Hubbard</i> presents violent verse and images that appear inconsistent with
  literature considered appropriate for young readers, the apparent intended audience.
  Verses in the book for instance refer to "John O''Gudgeon" the "wild man" who "whipt
  his children now and then," making them "dance." The effect of unexpected horror
  and subversion is accentuated by the book''s format, which requires readers to lift
  the flap whose front makes up one image to reveal another lying underneath depicting
  the next action. The metamorphic flap page selection exhibited shows on the outer
  flap Old Mother Hubbard leaving the house she shares with a dog to go to the bakery.
  When lifting the flap, she is seen returning home to find the dog dead. With the
  flick of a wrist and turning of a flap page, the narrative expands, progresses and
  mutates visually, textually and kinetically.</p>'
