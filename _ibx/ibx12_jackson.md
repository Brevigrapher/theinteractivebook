description: 'An acclaimed work of electronic literature and hypertext fiction, Jackson’s
  Patchwork Girl exploits the digital medium to create a non-linear narrative that
  may go in several different directions, like a web, depending on which piece of
  the story and corresponding images the reader clicks. Because the story itself is
  morcellated, just as the body of the female creature (the “patchwork girl”) at its
  center is, text and body are co-identified. This relationship places the reader
  into a role of needing to gather together the disjointed parts in an active process
  of piecing the story together. Mediated by clicks that can seem to lead anywhere,
  in contrast with the codex whose pages reach a defined endpoint with each turn,
  the body of this digital book interacts with the reader by making an explicit demand
  that it be made whole: “if you want to see the whole, you will have to sew me together
  yourself,” it says.'
