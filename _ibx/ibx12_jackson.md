description: 'An acclaimed work of electronic literature and hypertext fiction, Jackson''s
  <i>Patchwork Girl</i> exploits the digital medium to create a non-linear narrative
  that may go in several different directions, like a web, depending on which piece
  of the story and corresponding images the reader selects. Because the story itself
  is morcellated, just as the body of the female creature (the "patchwork girl") at
  its center is, text and body are co-identified. This relationship places the reader
  in a role of needing to gather together the disjointed parts of the narrative through
  the patchwork girl''s body. Mediated by clicks of a mouse or trackpad that can seem
  to lead anywhere in space, in contrast with the codex whose pages reach a defined
  endpoint with each turn, the body of this digital book interacts with the reader
  by voicing the demand: "if you want to see the whole, you will have to sew me together
  yourself.".
