description: 'Georg Major (1520-1589) was a Lutheran theologian who played a prominent
  role in the Protestant Reformation. His book is a commonplace book in the most traditional,
  Renaissance humanist sense: a collection of excerpts from the works of classical
  authors organized under headings. These include abstract topics from “arrogance,”
  “beauty,” “war,” “good men exemplified,” and “God” to “innocence,” “fear” and “hope.”
  An index helps the reader locate the corresponding pages for topics. The small size
  of the sextodecimo format book (16mo or 4 x 6.8 inches) facilitates the book’s intended
  use as a portable aid to help its owner memorize passages related to given topics
  and have them ready to recite when the occasion calls for them. Throughout the early
  modern period, commonplace books were often created by hand out of blank notebooks,
  and filled and organized according to the owners’ reading practices. Such commonplace
  books were our first personal information management systems before the age of social
  media, smart phones and laptop computers.'
