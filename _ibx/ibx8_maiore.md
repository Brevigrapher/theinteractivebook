description: 'Georg Major (1520-1589) was a Lutheran theologian who played a prominent
  role in the Protestant Reformation. His book is a commonplace book in the most traditional,
  Renaissance humanist sense: a collection of excerpts from the works of classical
  authors organized under headings. These headings include abstract topics from "arrogance,"
  "beauty," "war," "good men exemplified," and "God" to "innocence," "fear" and "hope."
  An index helps the reader locate the corresponding pages for topics. The small size
  of the book (32mo or approximately 3.5 x 5.5 inches), about the size of a small
  hand, facilitates the book''s intended use as a portable aid to help its owner memorize
  passages related to given topics and have them ready to recite when the occasion
  calls for them. Throughout the early modern period, commonplace books were created
  by hand out of blank notebooks, and filled and organized according to what the owner
  was reading. These commonplace books were our first personal information management
  systems before the age of social media, smart phones and laptop computers.'
