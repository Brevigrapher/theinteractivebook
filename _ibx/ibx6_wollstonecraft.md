description: This American edition of Mary Wollstonecraft’s early feminist manifesto
  was owned and read by a responsive reader whose interactions with the text surface
  in thoughtful underlinings and summaries of affecting passages and one word responses
  such as “fools” and “alas.” These markings indicate the reader’s sensitivity to
  injustice and outrage over the hypocrisies and double standards in eighteenth-century
  social attitudes towards women exposed by Wollstonecraft. The most emphatic and
  “hands-on” signs of the reader’s engagement with Wollsteoncraft’s arguments are
  the manicules used to wreathe lines that were found particularly significant. The
  book provides tangible evidence of the powerful responses Wollstonecraft’s revolutionary
  treatise stirred in contemporary readers. In its margins, the reader found a space
  for expressing their own views through digesting and reflecting on Wollstonecraft’s.
