description: A responsive reader owned this American edition of Mary Wollstonecraft's
  early feminist manifesto. Their interactions with the text surface in thoughtful
  underlinings and summaries of affecting passages and one-word responses such as
  "fools" and "alas." These markings indicate the reader's sensitivity to injustice
  and outrage over the hypocrisies and double standards in eighteenth-century social
  attitudes towards women that Wollstonecraft exposes. The most emphatic and "hands-on"
  signs of the reader's engagement with Wollstonecraft's arguments are the manicules
  (pointing hand symbols) used to wreathe paragraphs that the reader found particularly
  significant. The book provides tangible evidence of the powerful responses Wollstonecraft's
  revolutionary treatise stirred in contemporary readers. In its margins, the reader
  found a space for expressing personally held views through digesting and reflecting
  on Wollstonecraft's.
