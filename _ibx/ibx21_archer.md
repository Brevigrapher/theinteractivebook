description: Like Mattioli’s New Kreüterbuch HYPERLINK, another herbal in this exhibition,
  Archer’s book, is a “compendious, though Brief” compilation of names for different
  herbs and their general characteristics and recommended usages. The leaves of alder
  tree, for instance, “put to the bare feet gauled with travelling,” are recommended
  for being “very refreshing.” According to the author, John Archer (fl. 1660-1684),
  King Charles II’s court physician, this book, a follow-up to his earlier Every Man
  his own Doctor (1671), seeks to turn readers “in short time” into “Competent Herbalist.”
  Its “brevity” was intended to make the book “more portable” and “more useful, as
  a Vade Mecum” (“go with me” in Latin) or reference book. PARAGRAPH The owner of
  this copy allowed it to function even more as a vade mecum by creating a meticulously
  organized index on several blank leaves inserted at the back of the book. The terms
  in the index are of such wide-ranging and general ailments as “cough,” “cramp,”
  “bruises,” “belly ach,” “astma,” “gout,” “fatnesse,” “baldneses,” “dissentary.”
  By extracting the pertinent topics from each herb entry and compiling them alphabetically
  with corresponding page numbers in an index, the book owner mapped out the spaces
  of the book in terms of his own needs and made them easy to find. In this way the
  creation of an index was the operative step taken to turn Archer’s book decisively
  from an object to be read to an object to be used and consulted frequently. Given
  the comprehensiveness and density of the index, it is clear the book was subject
  to great care, both as an object of reading and an object of use in the owner’s
  daily life. As a soiled and worn vade mecum, it apparently went where the owner
  did.
