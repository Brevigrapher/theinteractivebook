description: "<p>Another herbal (see <a href= https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx20_mattioli/”><i>New
  Kreüterbuch</i></a>) in this exhibition, Archer’s book, is a “compendious, though
  Brief” compilation of names for different herbs and their general characteristics
  and recommended usages. The leaves of alder tree, for instance, “put to the bare
  feet gauled with travelling,” are recommended for being “very refreshing.” According
  to the author, John Archer (fl. 1660-1684), King Charles II’s court physician, this
  book, a follow-up to his earlier <i>Every Man his own Doctor</i> (1671), seeks to
  turn readers “in short time” into “Competent Herbalist.” Its “brevity” was intended
  to make the book “more portable” and “more useful, as a <i>Vade Mecum</i>” (“go
  with me” in Latin) or reference book.</p><p>The owner of this copy, apparently Charles
  Wealey (according to the inscribed title page), allowed it to function even more
  as a vade mecum by creating a meticulously organized index on several blank leaves
  inserted at the back of the book. The terms in the index are of such wide-ranging
  and general ailments as “cough,” “cramp,” “bruises,” “belly ach,” “astma,” “gout,”
  “fatnesse,” “baldneses,” “dissentary.” By extracting the pertinent topics from each
  herb entry and compiling them alphabetically with corresponding page numbers in
  an index, the book owner mapped out the spaces of the book in terms of his own needs
  and made them easy to find. In this way the creation of an index was the operative
  step taken to turn Archer’s book decisively from an object to be read to an object
  to be consulted frequently. Given the comprehensiveness and density of the index,
  it is clear the book was subject to great care, both as an object of reading and
  an object of use in the owner’s daily life. As a soiled and worn volume, it apparently
  went where the owner did indeed.</p>"
