description: "<p>This American eighteenth-century almanac or pocket diary represents
  a print genre that had first begun appearing in England in the mid-sixteenth century,
  and enjoyed immense popularity as a cheap and ephemeral book item. Almanacs were
  filled with information presented in charts meant to help one plan, make decisions
  or take particular actions in their day-to-day activities, including mercantile
  ones. The centerpiece of these almanacs were the monthly calendars with information
  pertaining to different topics, including historical events, the weather, holidays,
  phases of the moon, and astrology. The back of this almanac includes a table of
  roads from Boston to other New England cities, indicating the extent to which this
  type of book was meant to be carried throughout one’s daily activities. The clumsy
  unevenness of the stab stitching on the side of this one reveals its binding was
  homemade.</p><p>The almanac as a pocket diary was worn on the body of its owner,
  carried apparently as intended in his pocket. In consequence, the body of the unbound
  volume developed wear. The cover’s paper is tattered and creased. Almanacs also
  bear the marks of their owners’ activities and existence in whatever blank space
  could be found inside them, or made to have inside them, with the help of printers
  adding blank sheets when requested by customers. Here, its owner writes about his
  location on the page opening for the months of August and September: “From my own
  Appartment from May 1769 to Septembr in the same year.” The appearance of handwriting
  on the almanac pages creates a striking image of manuscript interacting with print,
  and of individual selfhood finding a space for itself in a generic, standardized
  setting.</p>"
