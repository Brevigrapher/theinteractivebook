description: 'Théodore de Bèze (1519-1605 ) was a prominent French Calvinist theologian.
  His Icones consists of two parts: the first is a gallery of notable religious figures
  who contributed to the Reformation, including Luther, Calvin and Erasmus. Presented
  in woodcut portraits and brief biographies, the gallery invites interaction by leaving
  frames blank for figures whose portraits are not available at the time, but will
  emerge after the book’s publication. Interestingly the backs of the engravings pasted
  in by the reader reveal that they were cut out of other books published close to
  the same time period. Additional scraps of paper are attached to the engravings
  or blank mirrors and bear sketches made by a book owner copying the portraits. PARAGRAPH
  The second portion of the book presents the 44 emblems that make Icones a notable
  example of the early modern emblem book genre. Emblem books set words and images
  into interplay with each other by presenting a mysterious visual icon or image with
  an accompanying epigram or motto. While the first section of the book, with its
  visual parade of illustrious religious leaders, appears unrelated to the emblems,
  the first few, which present images of frames with landscapes that surround empty
  spaces in which a circle floats, suggest what the connection might be. PARAGRAPH
  The epigram beneath the first emblem presents its circle as an image both of eternal
  life and God’s perfection, suggesting that by focusing on the image in front of
  them, and following the subsequent emblems to the end, the reader might enact the
  circular path of eternity. Through applying the idea of God’s eternity to one’s
  own life, one might situate themselves inside the empty space of the circle that
  is in turn surrounded by a frame. In this way the emblem book portion of Icones
  offers interactive possibilities as its portraits do, which similarly invite the
  reader’s “input” by leaving some of its spaces intentionally blank.'
