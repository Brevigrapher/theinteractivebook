description: '<p>Théodore de Bèze (1519-1605 ) was a prominent French Calvinist theologian.
  His <i>Icones</i> consists of two parts: the first is a gallery of notable religious
  figures who contributed to the Reformation, including Luther, Calvin and Erasmus.
  Presented in woodcut portraits and brief biographies, the gallery invites interaction
  by leaving frames blank for figures whose portraits are not available at the time,
  but will be available after the book’s publication. Interestingly the backs of the
  engravings cut out and pasted in by the reader reveal that they were cut out of
  other books published close to the same time period. This method of adding prints
  from other source establish this copy of <i>Icones</i> is extra-illustrated, as
  other items in this exhibition are (see <a href=https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx3_camden/>Camden</a>,
  <a href="https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx4_stow/">Stow</a>, and <a href="https://nyu-dss.github.io/ibx/ibx/ibx5_Radcliffe/">Radcliffe</a>).
  Additional scraps of paper are attached to the engravings and empty engraved frames
  and are filled with sketches made by one of the book’s owners copying an extant
  portrait of a distinguished religious reformer.</p><p>The second portion of the
  book presents the 44 emblems that make <i>Icones</i> a notable example of the early
  modern emblem book genre. Emblem books set words and images into interplay with
  each other by presenting a mysterious visual icon or image with an accompanying
  epigram or motto. While the first section of the book, with its visual parade of
  illustrious religious leaders, appears disconnected from the emblems, the first
  few, which present images of frames with landscapes that surround empty spaces in
  which a circle floats, suggest what the connection might be. The epigram beneath
  the first emblem presents its circle as a picture both of eternal life and God’s
  perfection, suggesting that by focusing on the image in front of them, and following
  the subsequent emblems to the end, the reader might enact the circular path of eternity.
  Through applying the idea of God’s eternity to one’s own life, one might place oneself
  inside the space of the circle that is in turn surrounded by a frame. In this way
  the emblem book portion of <i>Icones</i> picks up on the interactive possibilities
  of its portraits, which similarly invite the reader’s “input” by leaving some of
  its spaces intentionally blank for their own reflection.</p>'
