description: This copy of the first edition of the culturally all-important King James
  Bible was used by a family for several generations. The book’s physical elements,
  apart from its massive size, befit its historical significance. Elaborate paratextual
  (aspects of the book adjacent to the main text) features include monthly calendars
  for marking holy days with rubricated (red) letters, and genealogical tree charts
  of Biblical figures and their families. PARAGRAPH More than a century after its
  publication, the book’s succession of owners, four generations of the Davies family
  in Gloucestershire, England, began using its parts as a repository for pivotal events
  in family members’ lives. On the front pastedown and end paper are the dates of
  family members’ births, baptisms, weddings and deaths written in different hands.
  1742 is the earliest date recorded, the year when Reverend William Davies was born.
  Additional lines are devoted to significant events in his life, as well as those
  in his sons’ and their childrens’, with different sections reserved for different
  family lines. PARAGRAPH Storylines ensue with implied or explicit emotional richness
  in the very act of writing down the dates, names and descriptions of pivotal events.
  On August 20, 1816, for instance, the younger William Davies wrote, “This morning
  at half past 2 o’Clock my ever dear beloved wife...departed this life to my great
  and inexpressible grief (aged twenty eight years).” With these entries the Davies
  family in effect had interwoven their lives and times into the Bible’s fabric, an
  indicator of how influential and pervasive the King James Bible was as a dominant
  text in the lives of the English, gathered together by their faith as well as family
  connections.
