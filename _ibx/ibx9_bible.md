description: "<p>This copy of the first edition of the culturally all-important King
  James Bible was used by an English family for several generations. The book’s ornate
  physical elements, apart from its imposing size, befit its historical significance.
  Paratextual (aspects of the book adjacent to the main text) features include monthly
  calendars for marking holy days with rubricated (red) letters, and elaborate genealogical
  tree charts for the families of Biblical figures.</p><p>More than a century after
  its publication, the book’s succession of owners, four generations of the Davies
  family in Gloucestershire, England, began using its parts as a repository for pivotal
  events in family members’ lives. On the front pastedown and end paper are the dates
  of family members’ births, baptisms, weddings and deaths written in different hands.
  1742 is the earliest date recorded, the year when Reverend William Davies was born.
  Additional lines are devoted to significant events in his life, as well as those
  in his sons’ and their childrens’, with sections reserved for different family lines.</p><p>Storylines
  ensue with implied or explicit emotional richness in the very act of writing down
  the dates, names and descriptions of pivotal events. On August 20, 1816, for instance,
  the younger William Davies wrote, “This morning at half past 2 o’Clock my ever dear
  beloved wife...departed this life to my great and inexpressible grief (aged twenty
  eight years).” With these entries the Davies family in effect had interwoven their
  lives and times into the Bible’s fabric, an indicator of how influential and pervasive
  a book the King James Bible was in the lives of the English, gathered together by
  their faith as well as family and emotional ties.</p>"
